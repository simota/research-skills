"""Put a claim to the engines that did not make it, and ask them to break it.

    python3 research-tools/refute.py --running claude claims.json

`claims.json` is a list of objects with `id`, `claim`, and optionally `evidence`
and `where`. Every engine in `engines.runs_on` except the one running gets each
claim and is asked to refute it. The verdicts come back structured.

**Refuting is not reviewing.** Asked whether a claim is right, a model agrees;
asked to find what is wrong with it, it looks. The prompt below says so, and says
to default to refuted when uncertain — a claim that cannot survive a hostile
reading is exactly what this exists to catch, and the cost of a false refutation
is one argument while the cost of a false pass is a shipped defect.

**Independence is counted by source, not by voice** (`DESIGN.md` §5.4b). Two
verdicts from one engine are one verdict. The pool is therefore `runs_on` minus
whichever engine is running, and the count is printed with every result: with
three engines declared, a claim gets at most **two** independent readings.

**`STANDS` is not proof.** It means n engines looked and found nothing, which is
a floor on scrutiny and never a ceiling on correctness. A split is reported as
`CONTESTED` and never resolved by picking a side — with two refuters there is no
majority to appeal to, and inventing one would turn a disagreement into a verdict.

What counts as a refutation in this domain is `refutation` in harness.yaml, not
here: the tool is the same in every set, and the lens is not.

Treat the claim as refuted when: {refuted_when}

Default to refuted=true when you are uncertain. A claim that cannot survive a
hostile reading should not be relied on, and saying so costs one argument —
whereas letting a false claim through costs whatever was built on it.

If you cannot refute it, say refuted=false and state in `reason` what you checked
and found solid. In `what_would_settle_it`, name the one observation that would
decide the matter either way.
