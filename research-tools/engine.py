"""Run a checker on an engine that did not produce the work.

`routes.yaml` defers every loop route's `checker` to run time, because all three
CLIs read the same SKILL.md and any of them may be the one running. This resolves
it: given the engine that is running, it picks one that is not.

    make engines                     every declared engine answers, or says why
    python3 research-tools/engine.py --running claude --prompt-file p.txt --schema s.json

**The running engine is stated, never sniffed.** codex launched from inside
Claude Code inherits `CLAUDECODE` and `CLAUDE_CODE_*`, so a nested run reads as
its parent and any env heuristic silently mis-identifies it — which would hand
back a verdict from the very engine that was supposed to be excluded. `--running`
is required, and absent it this stops.

**A checker that did not run is not a checker that passed.** Every failure path
here raises. Nothing returns a default verdict, nothing degrades to "assume
fine": an engine missing from PATH, an engine that starts and produces no
parseable object, a response that does not match the schema — each is an error
with the engine's own words attached, because the alternative is a green run
that verified nothing (DESIGN §5.4b).

Engine quirks, re-checked by `make engines` rather than dated:

* `codex exec` rejects a schema without `additionalProperties: false`, at every
  level. Schemas are normalised here so callers write ordinary JSON Schema.
* `agy --print` returns an envelope; the validated object is `structured_output`.
* `claude -p --json-schema` returns an envelope; the validated object is
  `structured_output`, the same field name `agy` uses.
