# Wire this repo into a skills directory, and keep it inside its budgets.

# The repo is the single source of truth: each research-* directory is symlinked
# individually into every installed CLI's skills directory (claude, codex,
# agy), so each of those directories keeps whatever else it already carries.

# Every CLI reading a SKILL.md gets the same working tree. A host is only
# written to when it is installed here, and its own home — the parent of the
# skills directory — is what says so: judging by the skills directory itself
# would skip a host that has one but has never been given a skill.
